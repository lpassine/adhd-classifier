Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neurodevelopment disorders that affects 11 percent of children (Visser, S.N., 2014.) and symptoms tend to continue into adulthood in approximately 75 percent of cases (Brown, T.E., 2013.). 

Most of ADHD symptoms are characterized by problems in behavioral and cognitive control with predominance of inappropriate levels of inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity; It have been attributed to a deficient dopaminergic signaling, even though it’s underlying psychopathophysiology remains unclear, research has demonstrated that ADHD has a very strong neurobiological basis (The Science of ADHD – CHADD, 2022).

Early diagnosis and treatment are extremely important as the long-term effects of untreated ADHD have a huge negative impact for individuals and their families as one in this condition has more chances of suffering from poor educational outcomes, increased economic burdens, addictive problems, divorce, mental health issues and increases the likelihood of developing comorbid disorders such as heightened anxiety, depression, personality disorders, and antisocial behaviors (Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat, 2018). 

Unfortunately determining if a person has ADHD is a complex process as current clinical examinations have no single test to diagnose it, a comprehensive evaluation is necessary to establish a diagnosis, many biological and psychological problems can contribute to symptoms similar to those exhibited by those with ADHD. During the diagnosis it is necessary to rule out other causes and determine the presence or absence of co-existing conditions. For example, anxiety, depression and certain types of learning disabilities may cause similar symptoms. In some cases, these other conditions may be the primary diagnosis but in others, they may co-exist with ADHD. Such an evaluation requires time and effort and should include a careful history and a clinical assessment of the individuals.

Over the last few years, a rapidly growing number of studies have been published that aim to complement and improve clinical decision making based on biological measures that have led us to important advancements and findings in ADHD neuroimaging. A promising approach for ‘biomarkers’ can help scientists compare the brain function of people with and without ADHD and recent studies has shown structural distinctions in several brain regions, especially in children with ADHD (ENIGMA-ADHD study, 2019); Understanding brain network organization and connectivity may help us to better conceptualize the ADHD types and their symptom variability.

This new approach point that the symptoms of ADHD may be result from dysfunctional network connections rather than discrete structural or functional abnormalities, in example, individual differences in brain connectivity perhaps also underline the different clinical symptoms associated with each subtype of ADHD (Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience, 2020).

Inspired by deep learning recent approaches, this project aims to apply a deep learning model to analyze rs-fMRI data to identify changes in functional connectivity in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) by extracting features by designing, instead of hand-crafted features. It intends to explore the emerging path of novel diagnostic in the detection of ADHD through feature identifications (biomarkers) of ADHD individuals’ brains images and Health Control ones. Which may contribute to the field not only by increasing the accuracy and efficiency of classification but also lowering mistakes during diagnosis.
